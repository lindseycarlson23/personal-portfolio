# **Personal Portfolio**

## **Project Overview**

For this project, I created my initial personal project webpage. I wrote the HTML and CSS from scratch, recreating a sample portfolio page. 

This project helped me learn so much about HTML and CSS, especially related to page layout and flexbox elements. It is a work in progress, and I'm excited to continue to apply what I learn in bootcamp to making this even better.
